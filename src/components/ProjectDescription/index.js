      Hello! My name is Zachary Young. This is my website that I made to practice algorithms, as well as become more familiar with AWS.

      Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
      Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
      the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
    </div>
    <div>
      Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule",
      which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems,
      an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.
